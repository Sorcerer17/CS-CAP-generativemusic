----------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO INSTALL/RUN:

1. Make sure you have Pure Data installed. It is free & open-source software available for Linux, Mac, and Windows.
2. Download this project.
3. Open Pure Data. Make sure the DSP is checkmarked 'on'.
4. Open main.pd in Pure Data.

Note:
Make sure Pure Data is NOT in "Edit Mode" (Edit > Edit Mode, or ctrl+e). If you're in Edit Mode, you won't be able to interact with the program apart from dragging it around.
Once the program is running, make sure you press the start button and turn up the volume. Headphones are recommended.
The unlabelled buttons and sliders do things -- feel free to play around with them, or leave them at their default settings.
