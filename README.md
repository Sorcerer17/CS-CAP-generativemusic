1. Data - what data/databases you are using (if you are)
2. Architecture - what development platform you're going to use, and what components you will use
3. User Interface - what is the final result going to look like - how is it going to be represented. Draw a mockup of some examples of the user interface.
4. Procedural - What functionality and procedures you need (example for a game: you may need physics, user input, art, ...)
