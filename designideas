Sound 1 (ocean waves):
Use white noise generators with their amplitudes modulated
White noise is also lowpass filtered for rumbling wave sounds, and highpass filtered for crashing waves

Sound 2 (space harp):
Oscillators randomly sequenced but constrained to a scale
Fast attack, slow release

Sound 3 (bass drone):
Base drone randomly sequenced but changes notes less frequently
Additive synth- Levels of harmonic frequencies modulated over time to change waveform

Sound 4 (chords):
A synth pad that plays chords
It follows a chord progression that is randomly chosen at start
As time goes on, one chord in the progression will be changed to another chord randomly.

--- More sounds ---




Add reverb to some sounds, amount of reverb is modulated over time



TO DO:
* Toggle on/off whole instruments / add more deviation
* Zipf mandelbrot??
* pick a chord progression and stick to it? Maybe have a GUI button reset the chord progression
*
