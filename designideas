Sound 1 (ocean waves):
Use white noise generators with their amplitudes modulated
White noise is also lowpass filtered for rumbling wave sounds, and highpass filtered for crashing waves

Sound 2 (space harp):
Oscillators randomly sequenced but constrained to a scale
Fast attack, slow release

Sound 3 (bass drone):
Base drone randomly sequenced but changes notes less frequently
Additive synth- Levels of harmonic frequencies modulated over time to change waveform

Sound 4 (chords):
A synth pad that plays chords
It follows a chord progression that is randomly chosen at start
As time goes on, one chord in the progression will be changed to another chord randomly.

Add reverb to some sounds, amount of reverb is modulated over time
